## 6. Database Architecture Audit ✅

### Firebase Migration Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ Firebase-First Architecture

**Key Finding**: The platform uses a **Supabase-compatible wrapper** over Firebase Firestore. This means:
- ✅ All data stored in Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Wrapper (`/lib/firebase-db/server.ts`) provides Supabase-like API
- ✅ Direct Firebase Admin SDK available (`adminDb`)
- ✅ No actual Supabase dependency in production

### Database Collections

All collections stored in Firebase Firestore:

1. **users** ✅
   - Fields: id, email, full_name, role, is_verified, verification_status
   - Used for: Authentication, profiles, organizer verification

2. **events** ✅
   - Fields: id, organizer_id, title, description, category, start_datetime, end_datetime, venue, city, ticket_price, total_tickets, tickets_sold, is_published
   - Used for: Event listings, management

3. **tickets** ✅
   - Fields: id, event_id, user_id, attendee_id, status, qr_code_data, checked_in, checked_in_at, transfer_count, price_paid
   - Used for: Ticket ownership, transfers, check-ins

4. **ticket_transfers** ✅ ⭐ **ENHANCED**
   - Fields: id, ticket_id, from_user_id, to_email, to_user_id, status, message, transfer_token, requested_at, responded_at, expires_at
   - Used for: 24-hour transfer flow with shareable links

   - Used for: User favorites

10. **reviews** ✅
    - Fields: id, event_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at
    - Used for: Event reviews

### API Endpoints Using Firebase

**Direct Firebase (adminDb):**
- ✅ `/api/tickets/transfer/request` - Transfer creation with 24h expiry

**Firebase Wrapper (createClient):**
All other endpoints use the wrapper, which internally uses Firebase:
- ✅ `/api/tickets/transfer/respond` - Accept/reject transfers
- ✅ `/api/tickets/scan` - Check-in validation
- ✅ `/api/create-checkout-session` - Stripe checkout
- ✅ `/api/moncash/initiate` - MonCash payments
- ✅ `/api/favorites/toggle` - Favorites management
- ✅ `/api/reviews` - Review submission
- ✅ All other endpoints listed in file search

**No Migration Needed**: The wrapper provides compatibility while using Firebase under the hood. Both approaches work correctly.
