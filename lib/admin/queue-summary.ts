/**
 * Per-queue "how many, and how long has the oldest been waiting" for the admin
 * sidebar and the Needs You landing.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO orderBy HERE
 * ----------------------------
 * The obvious implementation — `where(...).orderBy(ageField,'asc').limit(1)` —
 * was tried first and fails on seven of the eight queues: each needs a composite
 * index that does not exist in firestore.indexes.json. Worse, the per-queue
 * catch below would have swallowed those failures, so the rail would have shown
 * "—" everywhere while looking like a working feature.
 *
 * Two further problems ruled that approach out even with indexes added:
 *
 *   1. Field naming is not consistent. `verification_requests` documents carry
 *      `createdAt`, `submittedAt` AND `created_at`. Firestore DROPS documents
 *      missing the ordered field, so ordering by any single name silently hides
 *      real work.
 *   2. Four of these collections (payout_review_queue, payouts,
 *      withdrawal_requests, disputes) are empty outside production, so the right
 *      field name for them cannot be confirmed from a dev environment at all.
 *
 * So: the count comes from an equality-only aggregation (no composite index
 * needed — this is how the existing counts in lib/firestore/admin.ts work), and
 * the oldest timestamp is computed in memory over an equality-only page,
 * coalescing across the candidate age-field names. That is exact whenever the
 * queue fits in one page, which is the normal case for pending work.
 *
 * Every source still degrades on its own: null means the read FAILED, {count: 0}
 * means the queue is CLEAR, and the sidebar renders those differently.
