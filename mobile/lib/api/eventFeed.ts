/**
 * The ONE published-events fetch behind every public browsing surface
 * (Home, Discover, Search).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the bug it fixes
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All three screens used to run `where('is_published','==',true)` with
 * `limit(50)` and NO location predicate, then filter to the user's country and
 * metro ON THE DEVICE. With a small catalogue that is invisible: 50 covers
 * everything. Past ~50 published events those 50 become a LOCATION-BLIND
 * sample — a Miami user could download 50 mostly-Haitian events, filter to
 * Miami, match none, and be told "no events in Miami yet" while Miami events
 * sat unfetched. The failure is silent and reads as weak demand rather than a
 * bug, so the location has to be in the QUERY.
 *
 * Country is the coarse, high-selectivity cut and belongs server-side.
 * Metro/city narrowing stays client-side on purpose: within ONE country the
 * 50-doc sample is no longer dominated by another market, so it is a real
 * sample of the right catalogue.
 *
 * REQUIRED INDEX (deploy `firestore.indexes.json` or this throws at runtime):
 *   events: is_published ASC, country ASC
 *
 * LEGACY DOCS WITHOUT `country`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A Firestore equality filter matches only documents that HAVE the field, so an
 * event doc missing `country` is invisible to this query. Readers elsewhere
 * treat a missing country as 'HT' (see `eventCountry` in data/metros.ts), so
 * such a doc used to appear for Haiti. Every current writer stamps the field —
 * mobile `createEvent`/`updateEvent` and the web composer both write
 * `country: <code> || 'HT'` — but the web dev seeder
 * (app/admin/dev/create-test-data) does not, and events created before the
 * field shipped may not either. Those docs need a one-off backfill
 * (`country: 'HT'` wherever the field is absent). We deliberately do NOT add an
 * unfiltered fallback query: silently widening to "everything" is exactly the
 * bug this replaces.
