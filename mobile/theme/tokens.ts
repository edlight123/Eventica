 * tikèm design tokens — the single source of truth for the app's visual system.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - The canvas and all cards are DARK. Teal is an *accent only* (CTAs, active
 *   states, price, links, small highlights) — never full-bleed header blocks.
 * - New / refactored components consume these tokens directly. The semantic
 *   palette in `config/brand.ts` (`useTheme().colors`) is derived from these
 *   same values so existing screens stay in sync automatically.

  // POSH direction teal is a SPARING SEMANTIC accent (verified / active-tab /
