  /**
   * FOUR tabs, icon-only.
   *
   * This used to build up to six (Friends, and Organizer/Admin, on top of
   * these four) WITH labels. Six tabs across a 402px phone is ~67px each, and
   * the 11px labels were `truncate`d, so "My Tickets" and "Événements"
   * rendered as clipped fragments — the labels were breaking, not helping.
   * The set came down to four, and then the labels came off entirely: at four
   * tabs the icons have room to breathe, and a label that only ever fits in
   * some locales is worse than no label plus a proper `aria-label`.
   *
   * The tab set is FIXED at four now, so keep it that way. The moment a fifth
   * is added the icons start competing again, and without labels there is
   * nothing to disambiguate them.
   *
   * Icon choices, since they carry the whole meaning here: Sparkles for
   * Discover rather than a Compass (which reads as maps and navigation) or a
   * magnifier (which promises a search box, not a feed) — this is "what's
   * on", and it suits a nightlife product. TicketCheck rather than a bare
   * Ticket because this tab is the tickets you HOLD, and the plain glyph is
   * already used elsewhere for an event's tickets in general.
   *
   * Nothing is orphaned by the cut. Both the desktop dropdown and the mobile
   * hamburger in components/Navbar already link /connections, /organizer,
   * /promoter, /admin and /favorites, so the two dropped destinations keep a
   * home — a bottom bar is for the few places you go constantly, not for
   * every place you can go.
   *
   * `isOrganizer` / `isAdmin` are still accepted but no longer affect the tab
   * set. They stay in the signature because ~30 call sites pass them and
   * churning those files buys the reader nothing.
