'use client'

/**
 * Pick the site's language. Lives in the footer, which is where a reader looks
 * for it and the one place present on every page.
 *
 * Two things make this more than a `changeLanguage` call:
 *
 * 1. **The server has to be told.** `i18n.changeLanguage` re-renders client
 *    components immediately, but every server component on this site reads the
 *    language from the `i18nextLng` cookie at request time and resolves its
 *    text from a local DICT (see app/layout.tsx) — /vision, /platform, the
 *    legal pages and the event page's metadata all work that way. i18next's
 *    detector writes that cookie, so a `router.refresh()` afterwards is what
 *    makes the SERVER-rendered half of the page follow. Without it a reader
 *    switches to Kreyòl and half the page stays in English.
 *
 * 2. **Endonyms.** The options read "English / Français / Kreyòl", each in its
 *    own language, not "French / Haitian Creole" in the current one. Somebody
 *    who has landed on a page they cannot read needs to recognise their
 *    language, which they cannot do if it is labelled in a language they do
 *    not speak.

   * Change the language, then RELOAD — not `router.refresh()`.
   *
   * Refresh re-renders server components but leaves the document shell alone,
   * and `<html lang>` is set by the root layout from the cookie at request
   * time. Measured: after a refresh the cookie read `ht` while `<html lang>`
   * still read `en`, which tells a screen reader to pronounce Kreyòl with
   * English phonetics and tells the browser to offer to translate a page that
   * is already in the reader's language.
   *
   * A reload also removes any doubt about the server half: /vision, /platform,
   * the legal pages and the event page's metadata each resolve their own text
   * from the cookie, and a language change is a deliberate, rare action where
   * a full load is the honest cost of being certain.
   *
   * `changeLanguage` is awaited because it is what writes the cookie; reloading
   * before it settles would send the old language back to the server.
