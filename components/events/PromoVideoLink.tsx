/**
 * The organizer's promo video, as a link out.
 *
 * This field has existed in the composer since the beginning and has never
 * appeared on the web event page: `video_url` was missing from the explicit
 * whitelist in lib/data/events.ts, so it reached the mobile app (which reads
 * Firestore directly) and nowhere else. An organizer typed a trailer link and
 * it vanished, unless they happened to look at their own event in the app.
 *
 * A LINK, not an embed, matching mobile's `promoVideoRow`. An iframe would
 * mean allowing YouTube and Vimeo frame sources in an enforcing CSP for the
 * sake of an optional field, and would let an arbitrary organizer-supplied
 * origin render inside the event page. Opening it in a new tab costs one tap
 * and keeps the page's frame ancestry ours.
