 * A clickable static map of the venue: the mobile app's `VenueStaticMap`, ported.
 *
 * A plain `<img>`, not `next/image`, and that is deliberate:
 *   - the tile arrives already sized and already compressed by the provider, so
 *     Next's optimizer would re-fetch and re-encode it on our own server for no
 *     gain, and bill us for the transform;
 *   - a failing optimizer request surfaces as a broken `/_next/image` response
 *     with its own retry/error semantics, which is precisely the thing the
 *     "render nothing" rule below needs to intercept — a bare `<img>` gives us
 *     a clean `onError`;
 *   - it also keeps `images.remotePatterns` free of a host we never optimize.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING — not a placeholder, not an error state, not an empty box —
 * when the event has neither a coordinate nor an address specific enough to
 * draw, when no provider key is configured (the situation today), or when the
 * tile fails to load. The address sits in text immediately above this in both
 * placements, so the section degrades to exactly what it looks like now. A grey
 * "enable billing" tile, or a broken-image icon, would be strictly worse than
 * the empty space.
