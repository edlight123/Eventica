/**
 * The organizer's promo video, played in place.
 *
 * This was a link out, on the reasoning that embedding means opening the
 * enforcing CSP's `frame-src` to a third party. The owner's call is that
 * nobody should have to leave the page to watch a trailer, so it embeds — and
 * the safety comes from lib/videoEmbed instead of from refusing: only YouTube
 * and Vimeo are recognised, and the frame's URL is BUILT from a template
 * against a validated id, never taken from the organizer's string. Anything
 * unrecognised falls through to the old link, which is the honest outcome for
 * a URL we cannot vouch for.
 *
 * Click-to-load, not an iframe on mount. A cold iframe is ~600KB of
 * third-party JavaScript and a set of cookies, paid by every reader of every
 * event page whether or not they ever press play — on the connections this
 * product serves that is the difference between a page that opens and one that
 * hangs. The facade is a still and a button; the frame appears on the tap.

                    over maxresdefault, which is true 16:9 but does not exist
