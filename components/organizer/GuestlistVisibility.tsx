/**
 * How the guest list appears on the event page — the face pile, the count, or
 * nothing — chosen by tapping the eye on the live preview of the exact row the
 * public will see.
 *
 * The reason this is a preview and not three words: "show who's going" and
 * "show how many" sound nearly identical in a settings list, and an organizer
 * picking between them is really picking between two *pictures*. So the choice
 * is made by looking rather than by parsing.
 *
 * This started as a preview row plus three stacked option cards, one card per
 * mode. That reversed: Posh's version is a single glyph you tap, and once the
 * preview is already showing the consequence, the cards were three copies of a
 * picture the row above them was drawing better. So the radio fieldset is gone
 * and the eye moved into the preview row itself — tap it and the same row
 * re-draws in the next mode, which is the shortest path from "what does this
 * do" to seeing it done. Two things the cards used to carry had to be kept:
 * the per-mode hint (now the small line under the sentence, where the label
 * "ON YOUR EVENT PAGE" used to sit — the row is visibly a preview already) and
 * a readable mode name, which rides under the glyph so nothing depends on
 * recognising an icon.

/**
 * Stand-in guests for an event with none added yet — see the comment at the use

 * made the faces mode look like a diagram of itself rather than the thing it
 * produces; the whole point of that mode is that the faces are the flyer, so
 * the preview has to show faces. These are the audience Tikèm actually has:
 * Haitian and diaspora, a deliberate spread of light and dark skin and of men
 * and women, everybody smiling, because that is what a guest list looks like
 * when a night is going well.
 *
 * Unsplash is the only remote image host the enforcing CSP's img-src and
 * next.config.js remotePatterns both allow, and the URL shape is the one
 * lib/flyerLibrary.ts already uses. Every id below was fetched and looked at
 * before it landed here — a 404 or a mis-cropped photo would ship broken
 * circles into the composer, which is worse than the initials it replaces. The
 * square crop is requested from the CDN so the circle never squashes anyone.
 * These never leave this control; nothing here is written to an event.
