   * Portalled to <body>, and full-height rather than tucked under the chrome.
   *
   * Two rounds of this bug. First the sheet was capped at `90vh`, and on iOS
   * `vh` excludes the browser chrome — so it overshot the visible area and its
   * header went up behind the navbar. The fix for that reserved the navbar
   * with `pt-[var(--chrome-h)]`, and that was still wrong, because the
   * composer has a SECOND piece of sticky chrome: the four-quarter progress
   * bar, measured at 57->85px. Reserving only the navbar left the sheet's top
   * edge at 80 and its header tucked under the bar again.
   *
   * Reserving both would be a third number to keep in sync. A modal is allowed
   * to cover the chrome — that is what BottomSheet does — so this one does
   * too: no top padding, `100svh` for the cap, and the header lands at the top
   * of the screen with nothing above it to hide behind.
   *
   * The portal is the other half. This was the last `fixed inset-0` overlay in
   * the app still rendered in place, and `inset-0` only means the viewport
   * while no ancestor creates a containing block. Nothing traps it today, but
   * the composer grows transforms and blurs regularly, and this exact failure
   * has already been fixed three times elsewhere (BottomSheet, PickerModal,
   * DateChips).
