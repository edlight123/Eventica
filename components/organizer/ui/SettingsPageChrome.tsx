/**
 * The back link and header shared by every organizer settings page.
 *
 * It exists to move that chrome across the server/client boundary. The settings
 * pages are SERVER components — they read auth cookies and query Firestore with
 * the Admin SDK — so they cannot call useTranslation, and their titles were the
 * last English text on otherwise translated screens. Rather than split six pages
 * into six server/client pairs, the shared chrome becomes one client component
 * and the pages pass keys to it.
 *
 * Titles are passed as KEYS, not strings: a server component may hand a client
 * component data, but it cannot hand it a translation it has no way to perform.
