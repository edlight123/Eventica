/* The icon is the ONLY thing that carries the variant.
   It used to be the surface: `bg-success-50` and friends are near-white tints
   (#F0FDF4, #FEF2F2, #FFFBEB) left over from the light theme, and the title on
   top of them was already `text-white` — measured 1.05:1 against the fill, i.e.
   literally invisible, which is the "welcome back popup I cannot read" report.
   `info` was worse: a bulk find/replace had deleted its bg outright (the
   orphaned trailing space in `'border-brand-200 '`), so it was a transparent
   box with a mint hairline and the page showing straight through it.

   500-weight, not 600: the 600s were chosen to sit on a pale tint. On the dark
   surface below they drop to ~2.8:1 (warning) — the 500s clear 4.5:1. */

        `bottom-4 right-4 max-w-md` was wrong on a phone in two ways: 448px of
        max-width does not fit in 402px, so the toast ran to 386px and touched
        the LEFT screen edge while keeping its 16px gap on the right; and a flat
        16px from the bottom put it underneath the mobile bottom nav, which
        reserves `--mobile-nav-h` (60px + safe-area) whenever it renders. Pinned
        to both edges it is symmetric on a phone, and the calc resolves to plain
        16px on every page that has no nav.
        z-[60] clears the nav's own z-50 rather than relying on DOM order.
