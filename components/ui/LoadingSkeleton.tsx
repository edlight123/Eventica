/**
 * Poster-grid loading placeholder.
 *
 * This used to draw a list of 64px square thumbnails with two text lines
 * beside them, and every remaining caller renders a POSTER GRID underneath it:
 *
 *   app/tickets/page.tsx            grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4
 *   app/favorites/FavoritesContent  grid-cols-2 gap-4 md:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6
 *   app/categories/CategoriesContent grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
 *
 * so the placeholder was a different page from the one arriving. The grid below
 * is the common shape of those three (2 → 3 → 4), and each cell is the house
 * poster: `aspect-[4/5]` with the title/meta/price lines under it, exactly as
 * DiscoverEventCard → PosterCard lays them out (px-0.5 pt-2.5, 15px title,
 * mt-1 13px meta, mt-1 13px price).
 *
 * It was also INVISIBLE in two of the three: `tone="dark"` resolved the bar
 * class to the empty string, so nothing was painted at all on a #0a0a0a page.
 * The fill now comes from the `.skeleton` class in app/globals.css — a sweep
 * over a baked-in rgba(255,255,255,0.06) base that cannot be tuned away, and a
 * still block under prefers-reduced-motion.
 *
 * `rows` is the number of cards. `tone` is kept for call-site compatibility and
 * has no effect: there is one canvas colour in this app, and a skeleton has to
 * be visible on it.
