/**
 * "Last <n> days with sales", where the number keeps its mono styling.
 *
 * The sentence had a <span> in the middle of it, so the naive extraction would
 * have translated the fragment "Last" on its own — which produces the wrong word
 * order in both target languages. French puts the adjective after the count
 * ("Les 7 derniers jours"), Kreyòl leads with it ("7 dènye jou").
 *
 * <Trans> keeps the sentence whole in the locale file and lets the translation
 * decide where the number goes, with <n> marking the styled slot.
